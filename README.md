## JavaScript Exercises

### Exercise 1: Bird Names Game

This is a simple web application built using HTML5 and JavaScript that displays a list of 10 bird names and prompts the user to remove all occurrences of the first letter, then the last, and so on until all letters have been removed. The user must use their keyboard to input the letters. When all letters have been removed, the program displays the next word. The UI design is kept simple and easy to use.


### Exercise 2: The Guru's Q&A

The UI has an "ADD" button that opens a pop-up form where the user can enter the question, select a category, and choose to save or cancel. If the user saves the entry, it is stored in local storage with the date of the entry. All entries are displayed on the screen in a scalable grid layout with the latest entries on top and oldest on the bottom. There is also a select menu to filter the entries by category.
